# StreamScribe

StreamScribe is a simple, lightweight, and easy to use application that allows you to record audio streams from the internet.  Currently, it is a CLI application, but a GUI is planned for the future.

## Installation
Be sure that Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.  Then, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  Finally, run `python3 main.py` to start the application.

## Usage
To record a stream, first, fill out the text field with the URL you would like to connect to, if it is not already there.  Press record.  A popup asking for the file name will appear.  The stream will be recorded to a file in the same directory as the application.  Click stop after you are done recording.
