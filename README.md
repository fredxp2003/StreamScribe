# StreamScribe

StreamScribe is a simple, lightweight, and easy to use application that allows you to record audio streams from the internet.  Currently, it is a CLI application, but a GUI is planned for the future.

## Pre-requisites
StreamScribe requires the following to be installed on your system:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (If running from source)
 - If running from source, you will also need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory to install the required Python packages.
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

## Installation
To install StreamScribe, download the latest release for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/fredxp2003/StreamScribe/releases).  

## Usage
After opening the program, all you need to do is enter the URL of the stream you want to record.  Then, after hitting record, you will be prompted to enter a name for the file.  The file will be saved in the output directory of the application, which can be opened from StreamScribe.
